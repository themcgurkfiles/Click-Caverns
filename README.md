# Welcome to Click Caverns!
Part dungeon-exploration roguelike, part clicker-game extravaganza!

Work-in-progress side project that I'll be working on during my time at Full Sail when I can.

At the moment, it's a pathfinding showcase with some 2D enemies to vanquish on screen!

# Controls

Hit `space` to travel to a random node on the nav mesh. Otherwise, it'll go on its own path and eventually reset the level.

Click on enemies with `left click` to defeat them! Each one has its own movement quirks to watch out for!

`Right click` pulls gems toward the mouse pointer. More robust scoring functionality coming soon!

# External Credits

The enemy assets are temporary, and are from the video game "The Binding of Isaac" owned by Edmund McMillen.
The treasure sprites are temporary, and are from the game "Shovel Knight" owned by Yacht Club Games.

# Current Features
- 2D Enemies that move along the canvas screen.
- Multiple movement types for and permutations of said enemies.
- NPC that navigates through a nav mesh to predefined paths.
- Basic environment.

# Planned features:

- Shop system.
- Enemies dropping gems.
- Mana and ability system.
- Clicker game elements, such as idle clickers and inactivity bonuses.
